IN-ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Jan performed least for the year, and I do recommend to the Stakeholders that he should be retrenched or sent over for some training on sales and customer retention.

2. Recommend Company D for a discount in the coming year to encourage them to purchase more or make them the company of the year.

3. We could replicate measures implemented in December for months with low sales turn out.

4. Find the salesperson resident in the Northern region, enquire about the method implemented and convey this to the salesperson in the western region.

5. I recommend that stakeholders inform all the inventory Staff to keep an eye on the beverages the coming year such that it does not get depleted at any time.

6. I recommend that Stakeholders should divert more funds into stocking items whose price is $1000 or less.

7. We can set up a Sub headquarters in New York to ensure more customers get interested in lower shipping fees, encouraging more prior unacquired customers.
